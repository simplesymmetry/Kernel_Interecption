# Project 2: Kernel Interception

Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) allow you to change the operation of the base operating system arbitrarily. As noted
in Pre-Project 2, LKMs are not able to add system calls, but theyareable to change existing system calls. This process
is known as a system call “interception.” In this project, wewill perform two types of system call interceptions: a
straightforward monitoring approach and a more creative re-interpretation of an existing system call.

## Part 1: Keeping Up with the Users

Goal:As a warm-up, we’ll make some simple alterations to existingsystem calls. Every time a regular user opens or
closes a file, we will print this information to the system log. However, we do not want this to happen for non-user
actions (such as those by the root user, known service user accounts, etc.). Accordingly, we need to intercept and
modify the existing system calls foropenandcloseto addkprintstatements for regular users. In the syslog, the
openmessages should look like

Sept 6 18:24:52 dalek kernel: [ 105.033521] User 1000 is opening file: /etc/motd

while the close messages may look like

Sept 6 18:24:53 dalek kernel: [108.511234] User 1000 is closing file descriptor: 2

While it is up to you to interceptopenandclose, we will provide an example of intercepting one of the system
calls we made in Pre-Project 2 to give you an idea of the mechanisms available to you. The following is a full example
module that does an interception. After this code listing, we provide commentary on how it works (this code is
available on the course Web site asmymodule.c).

#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/syscalls.h>

unsigned long **sys_call_table;

asmlinkage long (*ref_sys_cs3013_syscall1)(void);

asmlinkage long new_sys_cs3013_syscall1(void) {
printk(KERN_INFO "\"’Hello world?!’ More like ’Goodbye, world!’ EXTERMINATE!\" -- Dalek");
return 0;
}

static unsigned long **find_sys_call_table(void) {
unsigned long int offset = PAGE_OFFSET;
unsigned long **sct;

```
while (offset < ULLONG_MAX) {
sct = (unsigned long**)offset;
```
```
if (sct[__NR_close] == (unsigned long *) sys_close) {
printk(KERN_INFO "Interceptor: Found syscall table at address: 0x%02lX",
(unsigned long) sct);
return sct;
}
```

```
offset += sizeof(void*);
}
```
return NULL;
}

static void disable_page_protection(void) {
/*
Control Register 0 (cr0) governs how the CPU operates.

```
Bit #16, if set, prevents the CPU from writing to memory marked as
read only. Well, our system call table meets that description.
But, we can simply turn off this bit in cr0 to allow us to make
changes. We read in the current value of the register (32 or 64
bits wide), and AND that with a value where all bits are 0 except
the 16th bit (using a negation operation), causing the write_cr
value to have the 16th bit cleared (with all other bits staying
the same. We will thus be able to write to the protected memory.
```
It’s good to be the kernel!
*/
write_cr0 (read_cr0 () & ( ̃ 0x10000));
}

static void enable_page_protection(void) {
/*
See the above description for cr0. Here, we use an OR to set the
16th bit to re-enable write protection on the CPU.
*/
write_cr0 (read_cr0 () | 0x10000);
}

static int __init interceptor_start(void) {
/* Find the system call table*/
if(!(sys_call_table = find_sys_call_table())) {
/* Well, that didn’t work.
Cancel the module loading step. */
return -1;
}

```
/* Store a copy of all the existing functions */
ref_sys_cs3013_syscall1 = (void *)sys_call_table[__NR_cs3013_syscall1];
```
```
/* Replace the existing system calls */
disable_page_protection();
```
```
sys_call_table[__NR_cs3013_syscall1] = (unsigned long *)new_sys_cs3013_syscall1;
```
```
enable_page_protection();
```
```
/* And indicate the load was successful */
printk(KERN_INFO "Loaded interceptor!");
```

return 0;
}

static void __exit interceptor_end(void) {
/* If we don’t know what the syscall table is, don’t bother. */
if(!sys_call_table)
return;

```
/* Revert all system calls to what they were before we began. */
disable_page_protection();
sys_call_table[__NR_cs3013_syscall1] = (unsigned long *)ref_sys_cs3013_syscall1;
enable_page_protection();
```
printk(KERN_INFO "Unloaded interceptor!");
}

module_init(interceptor_start);
module_exit(interceptor_end);

Understanding the Example

While a useful example, many parts may not be clear yet. Let’stalk about the code in pieces:

unsigned long **sys_call_table;

asmlinkage long (*ref_sys_cs3013_syscall1)(void);

The first line hints that we are going to need to find the system call table in memory (using some cute pointer
tricks). We are going to usefindsyscalltableto find this value, and then change some of the existing system
call pointers to new functions in theinterceptorstartfunction.
The second line is going to be a variable that holds the pointer to the existingcs3013syscall1function. We
are going to intercept this call and replace it, but when we unload the module (ininterceptorend), we will want
to restore the original. This variable will let us keep tabs on the original so we can safely restore the old system state.
You will want to be certain to do this right when interceptingopenandclose.
Now, let’s consider our first function:

asmlinkage long new_sys_cs3013_syscall1(void) {
printk(KERN_INFO "\"’Hello world?!’ More like ’Goodbye, world!’ EXTERMINATE!\" -- Dalek");
return 0;
}

This represents what we are replacing our original system call. While ourcs3013syscall1previously cheer-
fully shouted “Hello, world!”, our injected system call will be slightly more menacing. At least it will be easy for us
to tell them apart. The beginning portion,asmlinkage longwill be consistent for all the system calls you’ll want
to intercept.
Thefindsyscalltablefunction is not something you will need to modify, but it willbe exceedingly useful.
In the latest versions of Linux, the kernel developers stopped exporting the symbol to tell you where the system call ta-
ble is. However, some system calls have to be exported, in particular,sysclose. So, thefindsyscalltable
function scans memory looking for the pointer that matches the pointer to thesysclosesystem call. Since it knows
that NRcloseis index into the system call table (since system calls are numbered consecutively), it can find the
memory address of the beginning of the system call table. Nifty, eh?
Thedisablepageprotectionandenablepageprotectionare functions that invoke a routine that
will disable the protection for read-only memory on the processor, allowing us to overwrite the system call table, even
though that would normally be forbidden. You are welcome to reuse these functions. To use them, you basically want
to disable the protections before a system call table modification and then immediately re-enable the protections. If


you forget to re-enable the protection, misbehaved processes will suddenly be able to modify pages that should be
protected. This can cause memory issues that are very hard todebug. You’ve been warned.
Theinterceptorstartfunction finds the system call table, saves the address of theexistingcs3013syscall
in a pointer, disables the paging protections, replaces thecs3013syscall1’s entry in the page table with a pointer
to our new function, then re-enables the page protections and prints a note to the kernel system log.
Theinterceptorendfunction essentially reverts the changes of theinterceptorstartfunction. It uses
the saved pointer value for the oldcs3013syscall1and puts that back in the system call table in the right array
location.
When you go to add your interceptors for thesysopenandsysclosecalls, you will need to place them in
the same place as the interceptors forcs3013syscall1function. You’ll then write your own version of these
system calls (equivalent to ournewsyscs3013syscall1function). Make sure you replicate the parameters of
thesysopenandsysclosecalls.

Helpful Hints:

- Copy and modify yourMakefilefrom the pre-project to build themodule.komodule from themymodule.c
    file.
- Test out the newcs3013syscall1before writing your own code to make sure you understand how to do
    injections properly. Remember that you can insert modules withsudo insmod module.koand remove
    them withsudo rmmod module.ko. Keep thecs3013syscall1interception around as an example for
    Part 2.
- When interceptingsysopenandsysclose, you can invoke the old versions of these calls by using the
    reference pointers you saved to restore the system calls. Asa reference, the instructor’s code fornewsysopen
    function was 4 lines of code. Do not make this step harder thanit needs to be!
- Thecurrentuid()function will return the account number of the currently running user. In Ubuntu, regular
    user accounts start at UID 1000.
- This may sound silly, but to test that the monitoring code is tracking users properly, you will need to open/close
    files as a regular user and not asrootor viasudo.

## Part 2: Getting Process Information

You will now create a new system call that gets some useful information about the current process, and you will
add it to your kernel by using a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) to intercept a system call created in Pre-Project 2.
In particular, you will interceptcs3013syscall2. Note that in Pre-Project 2, this system call did not take any
parameters. But, with our interception, we can redefine the function to take a pointer as a parameter. Naturally, this
will break yourtestcallcode from Pre-Project 2. This shows you both the power of LKMsand shows you why
kernel developers usually do not redefine system calls. After all, how manywaitsystem calls are there?
The function prototype for your system call will be

long cs3013_syscall2(struct processinfo *info);

where*infois a pointer to data structure in user space where your systemcall will put information about the process.
The system call returns zero if successful or an error indication if not successful.
The structureprocessinfois defined as follows:

struct processinfo {
long state; // current state of process
pid_t pid; // process ID of this process
pid_t parent_pid; // process ID of parent
pid_t youngest_child; // process ID of youngest child
pid_t younger_sibling; // pid of next younger sibling
pid_t older_sibling; // pid of next older sibling
uid_t uid; // user ID of process owner


long long start_time; // process start time in
// nanoseconds since boot time
long long user_time; // CPU time in user mode (microseconds)
long long sys_time; // CPU time in system mode (microseconds)
long long cutime; // user time of children (microseconds)
long long cstime; // system time of children (microseconds)
}; // struct processinfo

If the calling process does not have, say, a youngest child orany siblings, then return-1in the corresponding
fields. In Linux, children and siblings are not stored in any particular order. Therefore, the youngest child is the
process in thechildrenlist with the lateststarttime. Likewise, the next younger sibling is the process in the
siblings list with a start-time that is larger than, but nearest to, thestarttimeof the current process. Likewise, the
next older sibling is the one in the list with a next smallerstarttime.
You will need to have a copy of theprocessinfostructure definition in both the interceptor C code and the
user-space application that invokes it. Feel free to include it using header files if desired. However, be aware that
you may need to use different#includefunctions to access the data types referenced in the structure in the kernel
module verses the user space application.
To help you test, note that some of the information returned bygetprocessinfo()is the same as the infor-
mation you obtained in Project 1 usinggetrusage(). You might compare the two results to make sure your code
is right.

Implementation

Before you attempt to implement your system call, you shouldlook at the implementations of simple system calls,
such asgetuidandgetpid, to provide guidance. These can be found in the filekernel/sys.c. Here are some
things you should know:

- Almost all of the information you need to fill in the fields of aprocessinfostructure can be found in the
    structure calledtaskstruct, defined ininclude/linux/sched.hin the kernel source tree. Study this
    structure carefully!
    Some of the information is obtained by following pointers ordoubly-linked lists fromtaskstruct– for
    example, child or sibling processes. If a process has no children or siblings, these lists will be empty. You
    need to use the linked list macros described in Chapter 6 of Linux Kernel Development, 3rd edition, and
    linux/list.hto access them.
- The kernel fileinclude/asm/current.hdefines an inline macro calledcurrentthat returns the address
    of thetaskstructof the current process.
- Most of the fields oftaskstructspecify time values in an internal format calledjiffies, as discussed in
    Chapter 11 of Linux Kernel Development, 3rd edition. These are fields of typecputimet, and a ker-
    nel macro calledcputimetousecs()converts these time values into microseconds. This can be found
    ininclude/asm-generic/cputime.h. There are also macros for adding, subtracting, and comparing
    cputimetvalues.
    The field of thetaskstructthat specifies the start time of the process is a struct calledtimespec, that
    specifies time in seconds and nanoseconds. A macro in the filelinux/time.hcalledtimespectons()
    converts atimespecinto a number of nanoseconds.
- Every system call must check the validity of the arguments passed by the caller. In particular, kernel code must
    never, ever blindly follow pointers provided by a user spaceprogram. Fortunately, the Linux kernel provides two
    functions that check the validity and also transfer information between kernel and user space. These functions
    arecopyfromuserandcopytouser, and they are defined ininclude/asm-generic/uaccess.h.
    You will need to use the latter. See pp. 76-77 in Linux Kernel Development, 3rd edition.
    For example, suppose you have accumulated information in a kernel data structure calledkinfo, then you can
    usecopytouseras follows:


```
/* copy data from kinfo to area in user space pointed to by
’’info’’, a pointer supplied by caller */
if (copy_to_user(info, &kinfo, sizeof kinfo)
return EFAULT;
```
```
whereEFAULTis an error code.
Thecopytouserfunction returns zero if the info argument provided by the caller is valid and the copy is
successful, but it returns the number of bytes that failed tocopy in case of an error.
```
- You dont need to worry about page faults in the user space or about blocking and/or pre-emption by another
    process. Your system call operates in process context, which is essentially an extension of the user-space process.
    It has access to both kernel and user data, and it is capable oftaking page faults, being pre-empted, or going to
    sleep without affecting the kernel or other processes.
- You need to intercept thecs3013syscall2system call, as you did forcs3013syscall1in Part 1 of
    this project.

Hint: Start out yourcs3013syscall2system call with getting just a few pieces of information, soas to
make sure that you can return it to the caller. After you get this part working, add the functionality to access the
taskstructsof the parent, child, and siblings. Remember that the children and siblings are in linked lists that
need to be accessed using the Linux kernel list macros described in Chapter 6 of the Love text.

Testing your System Call

Write a user-space test program that callscs3013syscall2patterned after the one you wrote for testing your
cs3013syscall1call in Part 1. This test program should include the user-space version of theprocessinfo
structure described above. Your test program should print all of the information returned in theprocessinfo
structure for the calling process. Run it several times, andrun it from several different shells. Also test what happens
if the pointer argument is null or invalid; show that the system call does the right thing.
Note which fields change from run to run and which fields do not.Also, inspect the results to see if they make
sense. In your write up, discuss why some things change and how frequently they change.
For debugging your system call, use theprintk()function that you used in Part 1. You may see this information
in the/var/log/syslogfile or using thedmesgcommand. Note thatdmesgoutputs theseprintkmessages
immediately while thesyslogdaemon uses buffering.
